## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS, CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid

### What I learned

- You create a shadow effect on boxes using the property `box-shadow`
- The properties `min-content` and `max-content` are useful when you want a container to adjust to the content instead to a fixed unit or relative unit.
- The `height` property is more complicated that you may think
- Also the `auto` value
- And importing fonts. In this case I used `@font-face`, which I believe is gold-standard for privacy (?)

### Continued development

- I would like to become more proficient at grid and flexbox. I believe any developer has that sorted out at intermediate level
- Also relative units, responsiveness, and mobile-first development

### Useful resources

- MDN docs
- CSS-Tricks Grid Guide
